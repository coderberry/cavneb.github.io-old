Like any craftsman, a developer has a toolbox filled with items that helps him perform his craft. At a recent 'Tech Talk' at <a href="http://1on1.com">One on One</a>, I presented a few tools that I use in my day-to-day workings. At their request, I have compiled a list of each tool in my toolbox.

I would love it if you would also add in the comments the tools that you use. I'm sure there are plenty out there that would make my life easier!

## Text Editors &amp; IDE's

Depending on the language and framework I am working with I usually bounce between two choices: Sublime Text 2 and IntelliJ IDEA.

* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) is an excellent editor that meets my needs much more than [TextMate](http://macromates.com). I use this exclusively for all of my Ruby and Rails development. I enjoy how quick navigating between files is and how I can perform auto-alignment for hashes. The plugins are extremely simple to install using their plugin installer.

* [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is my editor of choice for anything Java or Groovy related. I have used it for a long long time with my Grails projects and I couldn't be happier. It is amazing how intuitive the IDE is and the code completion makes it so I have built-in helpers in my code. Excellent app!

## Browser Extensions

I usually only develop using the [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) browser. It seems to be the most suited for developers with their *Developer Tools*. I am constantly right clicking elements and selecting *Inspect Element* to view the source code, javascript console and CSS stylings for elements.

Here are a couple of the plugins I use with Chrome:

* [JSON View](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) - performs a 'pretty print' of your JSON in the browser with the ability to open and close nodes. Priceless!

* [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha) - allows you to quickly manipulate the appearance of any website (using custom CSS). This was insanely helpful when I wanted to iteratively change the CSS on an existing site. Check it out!

## Design Tools

* [Adobe Photoshop](http://adobe.com/photoshop) - I like it better than Pixelmator.

* [Color Schemer Studio 2](http://www.colorschemer.com/) - I use this all the time for trying to pick colors for my applications. I am colorblind so it is extra helpful because it choses complementary colors for me.

* [ColorSnapper](http://colorsnapper.com/) - This is a lightweight picker that let's me pick a color on the screen and places the hex directly into the clipboard. It also keeps track of the last 5 colors I've chosen. I use this most of the time.

## Menu Bar Utilities

* [Caffeine](http://www.lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) - When I go to meetings and bring my laptop I hate having my screen go to sleep (or even go darker). By clicking on this it keeps the laptop alive and awake.

* [GrowlVoice](http://www.growlvoice.com/) - This let's me chat with my wife over google voice text messaging :D Not related to developing but it let's me be more productive.

* [Flycut (Clipboard Manager)](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flycut-clipboard-manager/id442160987?mt=12) - Keeps the clipboard history in the menu bar.

* [Skitch](http://skitch.com/) - This isn't exactly a menu bar app, but it does have a menu bar icon and trigger. I use this app ALL THE TIME when taking and sharing screenshots. It let's you write on the screenshots as well.

## Education

* [Railscasts.com](http://railscasts.com/) - Ryan Bates taught me Rails. I'll leave it at that.

## Bookmarks

Over the years I have collected a bunch of useful websites that help me get stuff done.

* [WebCreme](http://www.webcreme.com/) - Web design inspiration.

* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) - Simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for popular user interface components and interactions.

* [Rubular](http://rubular.com/) - a [Not Just]Ruby regular expression editor (however it is useful with any language)

* [Groovy Console]() - Online Groovy console. Very handy!

* [Button Maker](http://css-tricks.com/examples/ButtonMaker/) - Nice little app to design a button with CSS and then copy the code.
