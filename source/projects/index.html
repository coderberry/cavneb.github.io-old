    <h3>Dirt Candy Shop</h3>  
      <p>Dirt Candy is a crazy-popular vegetarian restaurant in New York's East Village. I designed and coded their <a href="http://shop.dirtcandynyc.com" target="_blank">e-commerce shop</a> to coincide with the publication of the <a href="http://shop.dirtcandynyc.com/products/cookbook" target="_blank"><em>Dirt Candy Cookbook</em></a>.  I built the project using <a href="http://spreecommerce.com" target="_blank">Spree</a>, a fantastic, Rails-based, open source e-commerce platform. <span class="project-date">(2012)</span></p>
