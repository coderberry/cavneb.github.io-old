I am a software engineer who loves giving back to the community via blog posts and meetups. Lately I have become passionate about [Ember](http://www.emberjs.com) and JavaScript development. Beforehand, I was a co-founder of [ShareAPhoto](http://h71028.www7.hp.com/enterprise/cache/504712-0-0-225-121.html), Ltd, a European online photo sharing company which was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2006. I was the author of [Rails Pocket Reference](http://www.amazon.com/Rails-Pocket-Reference-OReilly/dp/0596520700) (published 2008 – O’Reilly). I spear-headed [TeachMeToCode.com](http://teachmetocode.com/screencasts/page/9/), a popular on-demand screencasting website dedicated to helping others learn how to program, which includes a popular series on writing a [Twitter clone with Rails](http://teachmetocode.com/screencasts/creating-a-twitter-clone-in-rails-part-1/). A couple of apps that I've created which are still around are [Reservation Counter](http://www.reservationcounter.com/), an online hotel booking engine, and [Crop Chocolate](http://www.cropchocolate.com), a 'deal of the day' site which is focused on scrapbooking supplies. I currently work at [Instructure](http://www.instructure.com), coding up Ember apps every day.
