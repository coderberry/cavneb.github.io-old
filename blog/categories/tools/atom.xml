Like any craftsman, a developer has a toolbox filled with items that helps him perform his craft. At a recent 'Tech Talk' at <a href="http://1on1.com">One on One</a>, I presented a few tools that I use in my day-to-day workings. At their request, I have compiled a list of each tool in my toolbox.</p>

<p>I would love it if you would also add in the comments the tools that you use. I'm sure there are plenty out there that would make my life easier!</p>

<h2>Text Editors &amp; IDE's</h2>

<p>Depending on the language and framework I am working with I usually bounce between two choices: Sublime Text 2 and IntelliJ IDEA.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> is an excellent editor that meets my needs much more than <a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a>. I use this exclusively for all of my Ruby and Rails development. I enjoy how quick navigating between files is and how I can perform auto-alignment for hashes. The plugins are extremely simple to install using their plugin installer.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> is my editor of choice for anything Java or Groovy related. I have used it for a long long time with my Grails projects and I couldn't be happier. It is amazing how intuitive the IDE is and the code completion makes it so I have built-in helpers in my code. Excellent app!</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Browser Extensions</h2>

<p>I usually only develop using the <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a> browser. It seems to be the most suited for developers with their <em>Developer Tools</em>. I am constantly right clicking elements and selecting <em>Inspect Element</em> to view the source code, javascript console and CSS stylings for elements.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of the plugins I use with Chrome:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc">JSON View</a> - performs a 'pretty print' of your JSON in the browser with the ability to open and close nodes. Priceless!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha">Stylebot</a> - allows you to quickly manipulate the appearance of any website (using custom CSS). This was insanely helpful when I wanted to iteratively change the CSS on an existing site. Check it out!</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Design Tools</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://adobe.com/photoshop">Adobe Photoshop</a> - I like it better than Pixelmator.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.colorschemer.com/">Color Schemer Studio 2</a> - I use this all the time for trying to pick colors for my applications. I am colorblind so it is extra helpful because it choses complementary colors for me.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://colorsnapper.com/">ColorSnapper</a> - This is a lightweight picker that let's me pick a color on the screen and places the hex directly into the clipboard. It also keeps track of the last 5 colors I've chosen. I use this most of the time.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Menu Bar Utilities</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.lightheadsw.com/caffeine/">Caffeine</a> - When I go to meetings and bring my laptop I hate having my screen go to sleep (or even go darker). By clicking on this it keeps the laptop alive and awake.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.growlvoice.com/">GrowlVoice</a> - This let's me chat with my wife over google voice text messaging :D Not related to developing but it let's me be more productive.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flycut-clipboard-manager/id442160987?mt=12">Flycut (Clipboard Manager)</a> - Keeps the clipboard history in the menu bar.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://skitch.com/">Skitch</a> - This isn't exactly a menu bar app, but it does have a menu bar icon and trigger. I use this app ALL THE TIME when taking and sharing screenshots. It let's you write on the screenshots as well.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Education</h2>
